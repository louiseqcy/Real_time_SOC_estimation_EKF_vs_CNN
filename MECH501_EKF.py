#%% Initialization
#1. Initialize the state of the filter
#2. Initialize our belief in the state

#%% Predict
#1. Use process model to predict state at the next time step
#2. Adjust belief to account for the uncertainty in prediction

#%% Update
#1. Get a measurement and associated belief about its accuracy
#2. Compute residual between estimated state and measurement
#3. Compute scaling factor based on whether the measurement or prediction is more accurate
#4. set state between the prediction and measurement based on scaling factor
#5. update belief in the state based on how certain we are in the measurement
